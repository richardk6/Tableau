Tableau - Citi Bike Analytics

This vizualization shows how Citi Bikes were used in New York City. Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. 

Each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. However, while the data has been regularly updated, there is not a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. 

I designed several visualizations to discover different phenomenons by looking at data from October 2019 versus October 2020.

I put all of these vizualizations in a tableau story, found here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/kelsey.richardson.blackwell#!/vizhome/Homework19Oct2019vsOct2020NYCityBikeUsage/NYCCitiBikeProgramOct2019vs_Oct2020?publish=yes
