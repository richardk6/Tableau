Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analytics

I am the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program and I am responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. I generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program. Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. 

Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so my first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

My task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.
I designed several visualizations to discover different phenomenons by looking at data from October 2019 versus October 2020.


Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
This is what will be presented to the officials, so be sure to make it professional, logical, and visually appealing.

I put all of these vizualizations in a tableau story, found here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/kelsey.richardson.blackwell#!/vizhome/Homework19Oct2019vsOct2020NYCityBikeUsage/NYCCitiBikeProgramOct2019vs_Oct2020?publish=yes
